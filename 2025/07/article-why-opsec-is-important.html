 <h3>OPSEC Is Not For The Military</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Operational Security (OPSEC) isn't a military secret - it's a survival tool. <br />
People think it's for soldiers, spies, or hackers. <br />
But it's for civilians. For you. <br />
Every day, you leave trails: where you go, who you talk to, what you buy. <br />
Someone is watching. Someone is connecting the dots. <br />
OPSEC is the discipline of controlling your own story before someone else writes it for you. <br /></p>

 <h3>The Map Of Your Life - Social Media</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
You post a photo. You tag a place. You celebrate a birthday. <br />
What you see as "just sharing" builds a detailed map of your habits, your schedule, your weaknesses. <br />
Your social media is an open door. <br />
The people you trust might not lock it. <br />
The people you don't trust might already be inside. <br />
Delete what you can. Control what you post. <br />
In OPSEC, less is power. <br /></p>

 <h3>Your Stolen Identity - Dangers</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Data breaches are not rare - they are routine. <br />
Your phone number, your mother's maiden name, your old passwords - they are already in dark places. <br />
Attackers build profiles. <br />
They use your past to predict your future. <br />
With fragments, they take loans, open accounts, manipulate your family. <br />
OPSEC reduces your exposure. <br />
You can't erase the past, but you can stop feeding the machine. <br /></p>

 <h3>Your Robbed House - Dangers</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Vacation photos posted in real-time. <br />
Routine check-ins at work. <br />
Public Amazon wish lists. <br />
These tell people when you're not home, what you own, what you value. <br />
Criminals don't need to guess - they need to follow your breadcrumbs. <br />
OPSEC is the lock you forgot to install. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Your Crazy Fan - The Scary Follower</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Sometimes it's not about criminals. <br />
Sometimes it's about obsession. <br />
Oversharing builds bridges for people you wish would stay far away. <br />
It's not just celebrities who attract stalkers. <br />
Ordinary people do, too. <br />
OPSEC isn't paranoia - it's boundaries. <br />
Boundaries that keep you safe. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Final Whispers</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
You are always broadcasting. <br />
OPSEC is the art of lowering the volume. <br />
The less you reveal, the safer you remain. <br />
Don't fear silence. <br />
Fear the noise you can't control. <br />
Control your breadcrumbs. Control your wire. <br /></p>
