 <h2>Privacy Focused Life - You Don't Have To Disappear</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2">

</div>

 <p>
Privacy is not a switch with two options. <br />
You can -and should- choose your level of privacy. <br /></p>

 <p>
Don't delete your social media account just for privacy. <br />
Don't burn your phone just for safety. <br /></p>

 <p>
Basic habits will keep you safe. <br /></p>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Choose Your Privacy To Your Threats</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Military operations specialists keep their moves in secret. <br />
They must do it. <br />
It's their interest. Their work. <br />
Leaking military data would be dangerous for the nation. <br /></p>

 <p>
The CEO of a billion-dollar company won't share their business plans. <br />
Their next step is private - to stay ahead of competition. <br /></p>

 <p>
Your doctor must not share your health data. <br />
Your file is only your concern. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>You Don't Have To Disappear</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
You don't have to erase yourself from social media. <br />
Always read the privacy statements. <br />
Set up the access to your data. <br />
Restrict it to friends, family. <br /></p>

 <p>
Make visible only the necessary information. <br /></p>

 <p>
Don't post images without stripping metadata. <br />
Photos may contain more information: <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Location <br /></li>
 <li>Camera type <br /></li>
 <li>Date <br /></li>
 <li>Timezone <br /></li>
 <li>Other settings <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
Never post your current location. <br />
Burglars and thieves follow social sites. <br /></p>

 <p>
Don't say too much. <br />
Less is more. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Your Images - Someone Else's Map</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Metadata - the information your images carry. <br />
It can tell a lot about you. <br /></p>

 <p>
The subjects - architecture, buildings, signs, text, etc. <br />
They scream about who you are. Where you are. What are you doing. <br /></p>

 <p>
Never share images that tell too much. <br />
Use some metadata cleaner. <br />
Remove all meta information. <br /></p>

 <p>
On Linux use the  <a href="https://github.com/DeadSwitch404/ghost-image-cleaner">Ghost Image Cleaner</a> to remove metadata. <br /></p>

 <p>
Don't over-share. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Your Phone: The Double Agent</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Your phone knows more about you than you think. <br />
Smart phones are not only phones anymore. <br />
They are: <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>GPS tools for precise location sharing. <br /></li>
 <li>Cameras to record audio and video with metadata like location. <br /></li>
 <li>Digital creditcards to pay comfortably. <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
Installed applications follow your habits. <br />
Always review what permissions they request. <br />
Read every permission - a grocery app doesn't need video recording. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>OPSEC Begins With You</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
You can use <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>TailsOS for immutable, secure system. <br /></li>
 <li>Tor browser for secure browsing. <br /></li>
 <li>VPN for end-to-end encryption. <br /></li>
 <li>Full-disk-encryption for data in rest. <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
If your habits are dangerous - your tools won't protect you. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Ghost Practice</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Strip metadata from your last 3 shared photos. <br /></li>
 <li>Audit your phone permissions. <br /></li>
 <li>Post nothing today. <br /></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
