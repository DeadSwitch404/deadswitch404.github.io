 <p>
An innocent email. <br />
A casual phone call. <br />
They warn of a password change. <br />
They demand an account review. <br /></p>

 <p>
You open a form. <br />
Your data bleeds. <br /></p>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>The Hack Of The Mind</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Dark Ghosts hunt your data. <br />
Not in the system. In your brain. <br />
Hackers breach systems. Social Engineers breach you. <br /></p>

 <p>
They go for access. <br />
They want data. <br /></p>

 <p>
Familiar voice. Corporate style and web surface. <br />
They suppress the alert in your mind. <br /></p>

 <p>
They demand action. <br />
You must log in somewhere. Spell out a password. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Creating urgency is the Dark Ghost's best weapon. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Signs Of The Dark Ghosts</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
They inflate the urgency. Immediate pressure. <br />
They "warn" you of losing your account if you don't log in. <br />
Or to pay extra fees if you don't act on the spot. <br />
Urgency is a clear sign of Social Engineering. <br /></p>

 <p>
There are minor design differences from the original sites. <br />
Some typos. A few mistakes. <br />
Look for strange URLs. <br />
Misspelled domain names. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Anomalies are there… <br />
you have to notice them. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Protect Your Kingdom</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Look for the signs of the Dark Ghosts. <br />
Never click unknown or strange-looking links. <br />
Shortened links can hide step-mines. <br />
Double-check the URLs. Always. <br />
Never share information on the phone. <br />
Enter credentials only in trusted, TLS-encrypted forms. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Train yourself to spot the anomalies… <br />
or the Dark Ghosts will teach you to do it. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Final Whispers</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
They try to hack your mind. <br />
Protect your perimeters. <br />
Secure your core. <br /></p>

 <p>
Social Engineering hunts you. The Dark Ghosts do too. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Ghostware runs not in silicon, but in your thoughts. <br /></p>
