 <p>
Harsh truths hurt feelings. <br />
Specially when you are affected. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>The enterprise world decays.</b> <br /></p>

 <p>
 <i>Seniors</i> without battle scars. <br /> <i>Bosses</i> promoted because of noise. <br /> <i>Teams</i> are just groups of individuals. <br /></p>

 <p>
Comfort over clarity. <br />
Entropy to hide their team's silent bleeding. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Organizations must change… <br />
or they must go away. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
It must change. <br /></p>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>The Loss Of Competence - The Age Of Noise</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
 <i>Experience.</i> <br /> <i>Practice.</i> <br /> <i>Knowledge.</i> <br /></p>

 <p>
They are scarce today. <br /></p>

 <p>
Once, battle scars were the marks of a warrior. <br />
Operators didn't collect likes… <br />
they collected clarity. Knowledge. <br /></p>

 <p>
The equation was simple: <br /> <b>Experience</b> > noise <br /> <b>Knowledge</b> > entropy <br /></p>

 <p>
In the new age? <br /></p>

 <p>
Friends and relatives enjoy protection. <br /> <i>They talk of success.</i>  <b>You made it possible.</b> <br /> <i>They present solutions.</i>  <b>You created them.</b> <br /> <i>They get a rise.</i>  <b>You did the work.</b> <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
In a world - where incompetence and impotence wins… <br />
Ghost Operators must team up to protect their Signal. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
 <b>The silent ones must protect themselves.</b> <br /></p>

 <h3>Headless Chickens Of The Organizational Ladder</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
 <i>Leader.</i> <br /> <i>Boss.</i> <br /> <i>Manager.</i> <br /></p>

 <p>
Head of everything… CEO… CTO… <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
The enterprise circus is open. <br />
The clowns fight on the organizational ladder. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
They dance. <br />
They sing. <br />
They make noise. <br />
They cause entropy. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>No team is safe.</b> <br /> <b>No project is secure.</b> <br /> <b>No individuals are concerned.</b> <br /></p>

 <p>
The enterprise clowns need spotlight. <br />
They want promotion before their lies turn public. <br />
They leave before the project collapses. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>No responsibility.</b> <br /> <b>No answers.</b> <br /></p>

 <p>
Their equations are: <br /> <b>Promotion</b> > team <br /> <b>Bonus</b> > project <br /> <b>Visibility</b> > truth <br /></p>

 <p>
You already met them. Right? <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
They feed from your sweat and blood. <br />
Don't give them fuel. <br />
They are clowns. <br />
Give them balloons… <br />
or a red nose. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
 <i>If you are one of the clowns</i> - read it again. Change. Or fail. <br /> <i>If the clowns feed on your blood</i> - terminate the process. Let them bleed. <br /></p>

 <div class="org-src-container" data-lang="bash">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo systemctl stop toxicboss.service
sudo systemctl disable toxicboss.service
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
The Silent Operators keep the gears rotating. <br />
We are the Operators despite the circus. <br /></p>

 <h3>Teams In Name Only</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
 <i>It's not just the leadership.</i> <br />
Teams are infected by lace. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>Members who know nothing.</b> <br /> <b>They hitchike your back.</b> <br /> <b>They suck your blood like a tick.</b> <br /></p>

 <p>
They're loud. <br /> <i>Buzzwords.</i> <br /> <i>Technical jargon.</i> <br />
Those are their shield. <br /></p>

 <p>
They speak fog. They don't understand their own words. <br />
This entropy is their natural protection. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Drag them out of their protective fog. <br />
Give them the spotlight they want - but on the truth. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
The spotlight of their  <b>inabilities</b>. <br />
Their  <b>lack of knowledge</b>. <br />
Their  <b>insecurities</b>. <br /></p>

 <p>
You're the Operator. <br />
You've the right to operate silently. <br />
Without hitchikers. <br /></p>

 <h3>Final Whispers</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Enterprises are civil war zones. <br />
Organizational structures are circuses. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <i>Clowns.</i> <br /> <i>Ticks.</i> <br /> <i>Lace.</i> <br /></p>

 <p>
 <i>Noise.</i> <br /> <i>Entropy.</i> <br /></p>

 <p>
The change is mandatory. <br />
Or the collapse is evident. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Silent Architects, Ghost Operators: don't give up. <br />
Our signal will be stronger. Louder. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <b>Whisper to DeadSwitch on Matrix:</b> <br /> <code>@deadswitch:matrix.org</code> <br /> <i>Maybe the Ghost signals back.</i> <br /></p>
