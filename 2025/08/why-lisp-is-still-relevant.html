The Silent Architect doesn't repeat himself. <br />
Yet, the Signal must be strengthened. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <i>Perl</i> is "the duct tape of the internet". <br /> <i>Python</i> is relevant. <br /> <i>Go</i> is fast. <br /> <i>Java</i> is everywhere. <br /></p>

 <p>
You know them. <br />
You use them. <br />
You love some. <br />
You hate some. <br /></p>

 <p>
It's not about the programming language in reality. <br />
It's about you. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
The language is the virtual extension of your soul. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
You don't love a language. <br />
You love the way it fits. <br />
You don't hate it. <br />
It just isn't for your thinking. <br /></p>

 <h3>Popularity Is Not Usability</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Could you list the most popular programming languages? <br /></p>

 <p>
The  <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">Tiobe Index</a> does it. <br /></p>

 <p>
What makes a language popular? <br /></p>

 <p>
Is it popular because of the  <b>huge user base</b>? <br />
Is it because large  <b>corporations use it</b>? <br />
Is it popular if  <b>special groups use it</b>? <br /></p>

 <p>
 <i>Measuring popularity is subjective.</i> <br /></p>

 <h3>Lisp Is A Framework</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Languages are extensions of your thinking. <br /></p>

 <p>
Read it again. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <i>What does it signal about you?</i> <br /></p>

 <p>
Lisp isn't just a programming language. <br />
It's a framework for expressing thoughts. <br />
Lisp is the art of modeling complex ideas. <br />
It's the way to create prototypes in minutes. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Lisp is the framework of your thinking process. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
 <b>Emacs Lisp</b> is the core of Emacs - still relevant. Stealthy. Fast. <br />
It's a functional scripting language. <br />
It's all around us. <br />
The Whisper Engine is pure Emacs Lisp. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>Common Lisp</b> is a Ghost of the machine. <br />
The general programming language of the minds who seek clarity. <br />
Stripped of the syntactic sugar. No entropy. <br />
Minimal core. Maximum extensibility. <br />
ISO standard, with many implementations. <br />
Some are older than you. Yet relevant. <br /></p>

 <p>
In modern IT Lisp isn't just a language. <br />
It's a cypher. Only a few can read, understand. <br />
Even fewer can write code. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Lisp is a cypher among the Ghost Operator's weapons. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Lisp isn't syntax, it's the field manual for thought warfare. <br /></p>

 <p>
Ghost Operators don't choose a language by popularity. <br />
You don't follow  <i>the Herd</i>. <br /></p>

 <p>
You're  <b>the Operator</b>. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <i>The Herd</i> follows  <b>you</b>. <br /></p>
