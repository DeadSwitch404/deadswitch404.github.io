 <p>
Common Lisp is not a trend. <br />
It doesn't scream for likes. <br />
It doesn't dance for recruiters. <br /></p>

 <p>
But under the surface - it breathes. <br />
Code written four decades ago still runs. <br /></p>

 <p>
Ghosts don't chase trends. <br />
We pick tools that endure. <br /></p>

 <h3>The forgotten blade</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Why did the world forget it? <br />
Because it demanded mastery. <br />
Because it offered  <b>too much</b> power. <br />
Because it refused to be dumbed down. <br /></p>

 <p>
While the herd moved toward syntactic sugar and hype-driven rewrites, Lisp stayed in the shadows. <br />
Untouched. Unbothered. Unbroken. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Why DeadSwitch keeps it in the toolbox</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
I don't worship languages. <br />
I use what works. <br />
Lisp works. <br /></p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li> <b>Stability</b> – Build a system. Come back ten years later. It still runs. <br /></li>
 <li> <b>Macros</b> – Not templates. Not hacks. Real macros. Code that rewrites itself, intentionally. <br /></li>
 <li> <b>Self-contained</b> – Deploy without begging for 27 runtime libraries. <br /></li>
 <li> <b>Control</b> – You get as much abstraction or raw metal as you want. Nothing in between. <br /></li>
 <li> <b>Silence</b> – Few use it. Fewer understand it. That's an advantage. <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
Common Lisp is not beginner-friendly. <br />
It's  <b>professional-friendly</b>. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Still alive. Still breathing.</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> – The editor that edits itself, still powered by a Lisp core. <br /></li>
 <li>NASA's older systems – Guidance software written in Lisp still runs in simulation. <br /></li>
 <li>Financial backends – Quiet, complex systems, still humming in Lisp. <br /></li>
 <li>AI roots – Before Python hijacked the hype, Lisp  <b>was</b> the AI language. <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
Legacy? <br />
No. <br /> <b>Legacy is code you want to escape.</b> <br /></p>

 <p>
This is  <b>ancestral code</b>. And it still obeys. <br /></p>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>The Ghost's angle</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
When you wield a tool nobody understands, it becomes your cipher. <br />
When you master a language nobody looks at, you become invisible. <br />
Power and invisibility - that's the Ghost advantage. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Fade out</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Common Lisp is not coming back. <br />
It never left. <br /></p>

 <p>
Use it not to impress. <br /></p>

 <p>
Use it to build. <br />
Use it because it works - and because it won't vanish the next time the wind shifts. <br /></p>

 <p>
DeadSwitch uses tools that outlive chaos. <br /></p>
