 <h2>The Anatomy Of The Modern Layoffs - The Hidden Truth</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2">
 <p>
Hot morning coffee. <br />
The PC cold-boots. <br />
A sip to heat up. <br />
The news is a cold shower: your workplace reports layoffs. <br /></p>

 <p>
Another sip. <br />
The mail client syncs. <br />
Cold shower again: "Important change in your employment". <br /></p>

 <p>
Shaking hands. <br />
Puzzled thoughts. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
What went wrong? <br /></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>What Went Wrong?</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
The short answer is "nothing". <br />
The universe looks for balance. <br />
As well as the market. Finances. Businesses. <br /></p>

 <p>
Income slows or disappears - the outcome must follow. <br />
Fluctuation. <br />
It happens 2-5 years. <br />
It's normal. <br /></p>

 <p>
Businesses build buffer to bridge this. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
But bridges can collapse. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Disasters need emergency protocols. <br />
Sometimes, the protocol calls for names. <br />
It's part of the play. <br /></p>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>When The Bridges Burn</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Incomes stagnate. <br />
Outcomes rise. <br />
Emergency protocols initiated. <br />
What went wrong? <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Everything. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Ghosts sense changes in the air. <br /></p>

 <p>
The fog thickens. <br />
Businesses can't see. Can't predict. <br />
Uncertainty triggers emergency protocols. <br /></p>

 <p>
The demand is low. Businesses save. <br />
Business to business staggers. The circle is full. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
So they reach for the nearest lever. Sometimes, it's you. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <h3>The Bridges Are Bombed Down</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Bridges are built. Bridges burn. Normally, they hold. <br /></p>

 <p>
The market has always been like this - for a hundred years. <br />
Old ghosts still remember. <br />
Businesses don't change. Humans do. <br /></p>

 <p>
Some bridges are not burned by the storm. Some are bombed. From the inside. <br />
Ego. <br />
Greed. <br />
Careless spending. <br /></p>

 <p>
Private jets over sales channels. <br />
SUVs over resilience. <br />
Ego over buffer. <br /></p>

 <p>
Their blades cut the wrong limb. <br />
Deliberately. <br /></p>

 <p>
They cut you to keep their toys. They call it strategy. <br /></p>

 <p>
They say it's always the dark ghosts: <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>AI stole your job. <br /></li>
 <li>Immigrants robbed your position. <br /></li>
 <li>You weren't good enough. <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
What went wrong? <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
They weren't good enough. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Final Whispers</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Either you collapsed with the bridge - or you hear the storm rising: <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>harden your shell <br /></li>
 <li>push your feet into the ground <br /></li>
 <li>stand up straight <br /></li>
</ul> <blockquote>
 <p>
You're a bigger storm than the approaching one. <br /></p>
