 <h2>Vulnerabilities Included - Vibe Coding Security</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2">
 <p>
Computers are an integral part of our lives. <br />
They manage our bank accounts. <br />
They power the grids that light our cities. <br />
Remote work. <br />
Messaging. <br />
Dating. <br /></p>

 <p>
In the core - there is code. <br />
Structures of  <b>instructions</b> for the computer. <br /></p>

 <p>
Vibe Coding? <br />
You say it  <i>normally</i> as a human. <br />
AI  <i>translates it</i> to the machine. <br /></p>

 <p>
But does it really understand you? <br /></p>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>The Operator And The Assistant</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
You know the logic. <br />
You understand the requirement. <br /></p>

 <p>
AI knows only what you  <b>share</b> with it. <br /></p>

 <p>
When your prompt is vague - your Assistant  <b>guesses</b> the rest. <br />
When you over-share - your Assistant chokes on data. <br /></p>

 <p>
AI doesn't write code - it models it for you. <br /></p>

 <p>
You are the Operator. <br />
AI is your Assistant. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
"The blade is sharp, but only you decide where it cuts." <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>DeadSwitch | The Silent Architect <br /></li>
</ul></blockquote>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>The Noise</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
AI is fast, tactical and comfortable. <br />
But it is trained on  <b>human data</b>. <br /></p>

 <p>
On their mistakes. <br />
On their wrong choices. <br />
On their bad tools. <br /></p>

 <p>
And on their  <b>security issues</b>. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Vulnerabilities included… by default. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
The Assistant drafts. <br />
You sharpen the code. <br /></p>

 <p>
Or  <b>can</b> you? <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>The Echo</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
You ask. <br />
AI delivers. <br /></p>

 <p>
The readiness feels like power. <br />
But the delivery is messy. <br />
The light is flickering. <br /></p>

 <p>
The code sometimes works. <br />
Sometimes it needs realignment. <br />
Calibration. <br />
A new direction. <br />
A new prompt. <br /></p>

 <p>
You can do it. <br />
Right? <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Signal Distortion</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
You asked. <br />
AI delivered. <br /></p>

 <p>
The code is baked. <br /></p>

 <p>
It runs. <br />
It works. <br />
It is ready. <br /></p>

 <p>
Or  <b>is</b> it? <br /></p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Web forms <br /></li>
 <li>Password fields <br /></li>
 <li>File uploads <br /></li>
 <li>Database queries <br /></li>
 <li>URL mappings <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
You call it  <b>interactive</b>. <br />
The Ghost calls it  <b>exposure</b>. <br /></p>

 <p>
Did you ask AI to harden these doors? <br />
Did you ask it to follow standards? <br />
Did you prompt for OWASP Top Ten? <br /></p>

 <p>
Would you let a tool manage your money with your code? <br /></p>

 <p>
Think it again. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>The Signal</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
AI can't write tools. <br />
It doesn't know the logic. <br /></p>

 <p>
AI writes code snippets. <br />
Fragments of tools. <br />
Models. <br /></p>

 <p>
The Operator - <b>you</b>- stitches them together. <br />
You read the code line by line. <br />
You review it. <br />
You understand it. <br /></p>

 <p>
Make sure there is no security flaw. <br />
No exposure. <br />
No mistake. <br /></p>

 <p>
Sometimes AI offers non-existent libraries. <br />
It can hallucinate fake data. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
You are the Operator. <br />
You must keep the order. <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>DeadSwitch | The Silent Architect <br /></li>
</ul></blockquote>

 <p>
Speed. <br />
Reduced "time-to-market". <br />
Complex solved with simple. <br /></p>

 <p>
Soft. Comfortable. Then… <br /> <b>The dream ends</b>: black daemons rise. <br /></p>

 <p>
Market loss… <br />
Reputation damage… <br />
Public shame… <br /></p>

 <p>
Peace to war. <br /></p>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>The Whisper</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
AI as an Assistant is strong. <br />
Human and machine are allies. <br />
The future is set. <br /></p>

 <p>
Cut the noise. <br />
Strengthen the signal. <br /></p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Work in  <b>small bursts</b>. Don't choke your Assistant. <br /></li>
 <li>Write  <b>clear</b>,  <b>direct</b> sentences. <br /></li>
 <li>Ask for  <b>security</b>. Safety. Stability. <br /></li>
 <li>Re-read. Check. Test. <br /></li>
 <li> <b>Don't bake</b> sensitive data into the code. <br /></li>
 <li>In doubt -  <b>ask a ghost</b>. They help you. <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
Sharpen your blade before the strike. <br /> <b>Or let it be sharpened</b> - if you don't know how to do it. <br /></p>

 <p>
The future is here. <br />
You live it. <br />
Read. Educate yourself. Emerge. <br /></p>
