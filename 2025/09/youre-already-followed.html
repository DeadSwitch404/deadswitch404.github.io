</div>

 <p>
You boot up your computer. <br />
You make a connection to the internet. <br /></p>

 <p>
Maybe you start a  <i>VPN</i>. A  <i>proxy</i>. Even  <i>Tor</i>. <br />
You think you're safe. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>Think it again.</b> <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Every step makes a mark on the digital forest floor. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>The First Leak</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
You connect to the internet. <br />
Your internet provider's ( <i>ISP</i>) device is there for you. <br />
It's a gate to the online world. <br />
It watches. Sees. Logs. For them. <br /></p>

 <p>
The moment you connect they see the connection metadata - <br /> <i>timing</i>,  <i>sizes</i>,  <i>destination IPs</i> -  <b>not</b> the encrypted contents. <br />
They see the open sessions. <br />
Either it's a VPN. Or Tor. They see it. They know about it. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Your VPN is like dropping dry leaves on your trail in the forest. <br />
They know that there's something. They can reveal it. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
The trace leads to you. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>Ghost Steps:</b> <br />
Stay ethical. Stay legal. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Your privacy is for protecting your personal data, <br />
not your crimes. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>The Silent Breach</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Your VPN is trusted. Silent. Encrypted. <br />
No one can see your traffic. <br /></p>

 <p>
Are you sure? <br /></p>

 <p>
VPN providers are similar to your internet provider. <br /> <b>You just shift your trust.</b> <br />
They see the source of your connection. They know where it goes. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <i>No-logs</i> policy? <br />
Think it again. <br /></p>

 <p>
Obligatory rules. Laws. <br />
Tracing errors. Monitoring services. <br /></p>

 <p>
Would it be possible without logs? <br /></p>

 <p>
You're as private/secure as your VPN provider. <br /></p>

 <p>
Will they resist lawful process, or have nothing to hand over? <br />
That depends on their logs, audits and jurisdiction. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>Ghost Steps:</b> <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Choose a VPN provider with good reputation. <br /></li>
 <li>Read carefully their End User License Agreement. <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
 <b>Your most important protection:</b> <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
Protect the signal. Obey the law. Or accept the trace. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-3">
 <h3>Breaking Down The Last Defenses</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
You know that your internet provider observes you. <br />
You know that your VPN provider listens. <br /> <i>Connections. Logs. Trails.</i> <br /></p>

 <p>
You choose the advanced path. <br />
You install Tor. Proxychains. On Tails. On Whonix. <br /></p>

 <p>
It's good. <br /></p>

 <p>
Still  <b>your habits</b> are signaling. <br /></p>
</div>

 <div class="outline-4">
 <h4>Time And Structure</h4>
 <div class="outline-text-4">
 <p>
You log in the same time every day to your usual services. <br />
The same day of the week. The same pattern. <br /></p>

 <p>
Structure and habits build a map. It's a trail. <br /></p>

 <p>
You skip logging in when you're on vacation. <br />
You don't log in when you are sick, or in the hospital. <br /></p>

 <p>
They don't see what's in the tunnel. They see patterns and anomalies. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>Ghost Steps:</b> <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Introduce a tactical, protective entropy. <br /></li>
 <li>Be unpredictable. Log in different times. <br /></li>
 <li>Skip random days. Or weeks. <br /></li>
</ul> <blockquote>
 <p>
Defensive Entropy is a best friend of Ghost Operators - <br />
to hide some signal in the noise. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

 <div class="outline-4">
 <h4>Metadata And Revealing Locations</h4>
 <div class="outline-text-4">
 <p>
Social Media posts and images are silent leaks. Evil beacons. <br />
Images hold visible and even  <b>invisible</b> data. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <i>Places</i>,  <i>buildings</i> and  <i>landmarks</i> can reveal your exact location. <br />
Even without mentioning it. <br /></p>

 <p>
There is a more dangerous enemy -  <b>the metadata</b>. <br />
Silently embedded in your files. Photos. Documents. <br /></p>

 <p>
It contains multiple pieces of information, like: <br /></p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Device information. <br /></li>
 <li>GPS coordinates. <br /></li>
 <li>Device or tool settings. <br /></li>
 <li>Date and time. <br /></li>
 <li>Username. <br /></li>
 <li>Email address. <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
They're dangerous one by one. <br />
Together they're the path to find you. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>Ghost Steps:</b> <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Always remove metadata before posting files and images. <br /></li>
 <li>Verify it before clicking the  <code>Send</code> or  <code>Comment</code> button. <br /></li>
 <li>If you're not sure -  <b>don't post</b>. <br /></li>
 <li>Never post on the spot. Wait. Analyze. Verify. Post later. <br /></li>
</ul> <blockquote>
 <p>
Visible threats are scary. <br />
The invisible ones are the most dangerous. <br /></p>

 <div class="outline-4">
 <h4>Reviews, Comments And Arguments</h4>
 <div class="outline-text-4">
 <p>
Building an observation profile isn't just about names, locations and dates. <br /></p>

 <p>
Data is helpful in the collection: <br /></p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li> <i>Spending habits.</i> <br /></li>
 <li> <i>Choice preferences.</i> <br /></li>
 <li> <i>Dislikes.</i> <br /></li>
 <li> <i>Actions.</i> <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
They're breadcrumbs to make the profile more accurate. <br />
To increase the probability. To tune the observation. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <i>They even set up traps.</i> <br /></p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>A heated argument. <br /></li>
 <li>An out-of-hand debate. <br /></li>
 <li>A well-placed trigger. <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
Sometimes they're not just passively observing. They  <b>trigger</b> you with traps. <br /></p>

 <p>
You answer in anger. In frustration. <br />
Your answer isn't calculated. It reveals information. Personality traits. Opinions. <br />
It means a more exact profile. <br /></p>

 <p>
Then they can build more deliberate traps. Triggers. <br />
Funnel it down deeper in your head. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>Ghost Steps:</b> <br />
Cut the signal to them. <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Don't review products and services. <br /></li>
 <li>Limit purchases tied to your real identity. <br /></li>
 <li>Minimize public comments. <br /></li>
</ul> <p>
Never answer in anger. Don't type when you're frustrated. <br />
Walk away. Breathe. Suspect a deliberate trigger. A trap. <br /></p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
It's not necessary to express your opinion to everyone. <br />
It's enough if those know it who matter to you. <br /></p>

 <h3>Smartphones And Other IoT Devices - The Endless Beacons</h3>
 <div class="outline-text-3">
 <p>
Your best friend can be your worst enemy. <br />
It's in your house. In your family. <br />
In your pocket. <br /></p>

 <p>
It's connected. It beacons. 24/7. <br />
You can harden your computer. <br />
But your smart devices are different beasts. <br /></p>

 <p>
Every app is a new attack vector. A possible new breach. <br />
They watch. They listen. They signal back home. <br />
Especially if you don't check the app permissions. <br /></p>

 <p>
Saved forms, users, passwords and payment details are not comfort. <br />
It's a cage. These are invisible chains to service providers and companies. <br />
Your smart devices make it easy to put more chains on you. <br /></p>

 <p>
You don't pay only with your money - you pay with your data as well. <br />
You pay with your freedom. <br /></p>

 <p>
 <b>Ghost Steps:</b> <br /></p>
 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Always check the app permissions. <br /></li>
 <li>Install only the necessary apps. <br /></li>
 <li>Don't let app remember your data. <br /></li>
 <li>Disable location when you don't use it. <br /></li>
 <li>Minimize IoT and rogue devices in your home. <br /></li>
 <li>Firewall your infrastructure. <br /></li>
</ul> <blockquote>
 <p>
Today's comfort is tomorrow's head ache. <br /></p>
