    <h1>Services – Harden. Automate. Defend.</h1>

    <p>The digital battlefield is real. I don't just optimize – I fortify. Whether you need relentless automation, airtight security, or a full-scale cyber overhaul, my expertise ensures efficiency, resilience, and absolute control.</p>

    <h2>Automation, DevOps & CI/CD – Cut the Inefficiency. Control the Flow.</h2>
    <p>Time is wasted where automation is ignored. I don't do manual. I craft Ansible-driven automation that eliminates redundancy, enhances efficiency, and locks errors out of the system.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configuration management – Standardized, hardened, automated.</li>
      <li>CI/CD pipelines – Flawless, efficient, self-sustaining.</li>
      <li>Task automation – Because repetition is failure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your infrastructure doesn't have to be fragile. Let's automate. Let's optimize.</p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity – Harden or Fall.</h2>
    <p>Cyber threats evolve. So should your defenses. I assess. I identify. I neutralize.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Security posture assessments – Find the cracks before they become breaches.</li>
      <li>Vulnerability mitigation – Lock down before attackers even get the chance.</li>
      <li>Best-practice implementation – Because "good enough" isn't enough.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The cost of weak security? Total compromise. Let's fix that.</p>

    <h2>Ethical Hacking / Penetration Testing – Know Your Weakness Before They Do.</h2>
    <p>Attackers don't ask permission. Neither do I. I simulate real-world threats to break your security before the bad actors do.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Targeted attack simulations – Understand where you're weak.</li>
      <li>Full-scale penetration testing – Test everything. Trust nothing.</li>
      <li>Actionable defense strategies – Because knowing is half the battle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your security isn't real until it's tested. Let's see if you're truly protected.</p>

    <h2>Consulting – Precision. Strategy. Resilience.</h2>
    <p>Tech should be an advantage, not a liability.</p>
    <p>I analyze. I strategize. I execute.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom cybersecurity roadmaps – Your defenses, built right.</li>
      <li>Infrastructure hardening – Because attack surfaces should be minimized.</li>
      <li>Tailored solutions – No templates. No nonsense. Just what you need.</li>
    </ul>
