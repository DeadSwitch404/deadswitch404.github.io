        <h2>Where Control Meets Cyber Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>Privacy is not a luxury. Security is not an afterthought. Automation is not a convenience. These are weapons in the fight against inefficiency, surveillance, and bad cybersecurity practices.</p>

        <h2>DeadSwitch – The Silent Architect</h2>
        <p><b>DeadSwitch</b> is the Cyber Ghost – the author of the articles on this portal.</p>
        <p>He started off of <i>Tom's IT Cafe</i>. It's his own space. The <b>Silent Architect's Whispers</b>.</p>
        <p>You can tune in to catch the signal - or live in the noise.</p>
