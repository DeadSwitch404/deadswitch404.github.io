        <h2>Where Control Meets Cyber Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>Privacy is not a luxury. Security is not an afterthought. Automation is not a convenience. They are weapons against inefficiency, surveillance, and weak cybersecurity.</p>

        <h2>DeadSwitch – The Silent Architect</h2>
        <p><strong>DeadSwitch</strong> is the Cyber Ghost behind this portal.</p>
        <p>He began on <i>Tom's IT Cafe</i> with Tom – The Ghost Operator. Now he operates in his own space: <strong>The Silent Architect's Whispers</strong>.</p>
        <p>You can tune in to catch the signal – or live in the noise.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You cannot contact DeadSwitch directly.</li>
